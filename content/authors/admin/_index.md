M.Eng. in Petroleum Engineering with +4 years of experience on integrated Reservoir Engineering, focused on the realization of optimal development plans of primary and secondary Oil & Gas reserves, applying transversal knowledge of geoscience, reservoir-well-surface, economic and risk. Great interest in the development of work tools through numerical programming languages (Spreadsheets, Octave and Julia).

Knowledge in reservoir simulation for enhanced oil recovery applications such as water and steam injection. Comprehensive experience Reservoir-well-surface models nodal analysis and performance evaluation of artificial lift systems (ESP, UBH, PCP, UBM). Petrophysical characterization and quantification of reserves by volumetric methods, declination curves and material balance. Evaluation of exploration prospects with geological knowledge.

Knowledge in the implementation of artificial intelligence algorithms. Able to build dynamic optimization models including deterministic and stochastic models for decision making and risk analysis. Good understanding of physical, mathematical and financial models for the economic evaluation of projects. Understanding the English foreign language and abilities to work in a multidisciplinary team
